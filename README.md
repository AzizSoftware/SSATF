Financial Transaction Anomaly Monitoring System (MVP)

Project Overview

This project proposes the development of a Financial Transaction Anomaly Monitoring System designed to detect, analyze, and visualize anomalies in financial transaction streams in real-time. Developed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), this platform aims to enhance compliance, minimize operational risks, and optimize data surveillance within high-volume financial environments.

The system leverages a modern, scalable, and resilient event-driven microservices architecture to provide instant insights into potential errors, fraud, or technical failures.

Key Features (MVP)
Continuous Transaction Ingestion: Ingests financial transaction streams in real-time.

Instant Anomaly Detection: Analyzes each transaction against configurable business rules.

Enriched Anomaly Data: Enriches detected anomalous transactions with detailed metadata.

Rapid Data Storage & Indexing: Stores and indexes all data for quick search and aggregation.

Intuitive Anomaly Visualization: Presents anomalies and key indicators via an interactive dashboard.

Architecture
The system is built upon an event-driven microservices architecture, promoting modularity, scalability, and resilience. Communication between services is primarily asynchronous via a Message Broker (Kafka).

Core Components:
Transaction Generator / API Ingestion Service:

Role: Responsible for ingesting raw financial transaction data. This can be via an API endpoint (for push-based ingestion) or by reading from an external source like a MongoDB database (for pull-based ingestion).

Internal Modules: API/Endpoint, Data Validation, Source Data Access (if applicable, e.g., MongoDB client), Kafka Producer (for raw transactions).

Message Broker: Kafka:

Role: A distributed streaming platform that facilitates high-throughput, fault-tolerant communication between microservices. It acts as the central nervous system for event propagation.

Anomaly Detection Service:

Role: Consumes raw transaction events from Kafka, applies configurable business rules to detect anomalies, and enriches anomalous transactions.

Internal Modules: Kafka Consumer (for raw transactions), Rule Engine, Data Enrichment, Kafka Producer (for enriched anomalies).

Audit Ingestion Service:

Role: Consumes enriched anomaly events from Kafka, performs any necessary transformation/cleanup, and persists the data into Elasticsearch for auditing and analysis.

Internal Modules: Kafka Consumer (for enriched anomalies), Transformation/Cleanup, Elasticsearch Client.

Database / Indexing: Elasticsearch:

Role: A distributed search and analytics engine used for storing, indexing, and enabling fast full-text search and aggregation of anomaly data.

Visualization Service: Kibana:

Role: An open-source data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch. It connects directly to Elasticsearch to allow operations analysts to explore, visualize, and monitor anomaly data through interactive dashboards.

Data Flow Overview:
External Transaction Source sends transactions to the Transaction Generator / API Ingestion Service.

Transaction Generator / API Ingestion Service publishes "Raw Transaction Events" to Kafka.

Anomaly Detection Service consumes "Raw Transaction Events" from Kafka, processes them, and publishes "Enriched Anomaly Events" back to Kafka.

Audit Ingestion Service consumes "Enriched Anomaly Events" from Kafka and stores them in Elasticsearch.

Kibana queries and visualizes the anomaly data stored in Elasticsearch, presenting it to the Operations Analyst.
